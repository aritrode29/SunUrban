## Why Files Were Archived

### Old Visualization Files
These files were generated by:
- **Superseded scripts** - Replaced by optimized versions
- **Deleted modules** - Modules that were removed during consolidation
- **Old scenarios** - PyPSA scenarios that were replaced by optimized versions

### Current Active Visualizations
All current visualizations are in the `visualizations/` folder and are generated by active scripts:
- `optimized_*` files - Generated by optimized scenario scripts
- `irr_*` files - Generated by IRR analysis scripts
